# ETL
The APIs from Kaggle and Banxico download the performance of the bitcoin and US dollar.<br>
The performance of bitcoin has been tracked to show its high variability, however, the US dollar was set as a standard with a much more stable growth over time.<br>
Having considered bitcoin as a currency, it's behavior resembles more like shares from a technological and foreign company than a commercial paper from a well established government.<br>
In such as case, the ability of bitcoin to buy products from certain retailers must be seen as a credit note or a voucher issued by the provider instead a legitimate currency.<br>
The US dollar is supported by assets, such as real state property and its gross domestic product. <br>
On the other hand, bitcoin relies exclusively on 'digital assets' whose value is determined subjectively and commissions are only worth how popular this 'investment' is in the market.<br>
